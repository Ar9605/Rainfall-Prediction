This rainfall prediction project uses Python and machine learning libraries to forecast rainfall. The project involves several key steps:

Data Handling: Libraries like pandas and numpy are used for data manipulation and analysis, while SimpleImputer from sklearn handles missing values.
Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn are employed for data visualization to explore patterns and correlations in the dataset.
Preprocessing: Data is standardized using StandardScaler and encoded with OneHotEncoder or LabelEncoder to prepare it for model training.
Model Training: Various machine learning models such as SVC, LogisticRegression, and RandomForestClassifier are trained using Pipeline to streamline preprocessing and model training.
Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix to ensure robust predictions.
This comprehensive approach leverages the power of Python's machine learning ecosystem to develop an accurate and reliable rainfall prediction model.
